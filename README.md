# @seznam/changeset-create-release
Create a release from changelog.md files generated by changeset cli during release. This action extracts tags from current commit (should be used in the release workflow), and based on the tags, extracts changelog for each tag and creates a Github release.

## Usage

```yaml
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master

jobs:
  release:
    name: Release
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          # This is important, since we need to also fetch tags within the last commit
          fetch-depth: 0

      - name: Release new versions
        env:
          NODE_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.NPM_TOKEN }}
        run: npm run release:publish

      # This is the action that creates the release
      - uses: seznam/changeset-create-release@main
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```
